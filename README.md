# Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my algorithms repository! Here you'll find a collection of algorithms I've implemented while learning programming. These algorithms cover a variety of topics and problem-solving approaches.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of algorithms I've learned from various sources, including The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need by ThePrimeagen, Codewars, and Leetcode as well as Introduction to Algorithms, fourth edition.

## Algorithms Included

### Search Algorithms
- **Binary Search:** Efficiently finds an element in a sorted array.
- **Two Crystal Balls:** A strategy for searching an element in a set of possibly defective items.

### Sort Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort:** A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted.

### Data Structures
- **Linked List:** Implementation of a linked list data structure in C#.
- **Queue:** Implementation of a basic queue data structure in C#.
- **Stack:** Implementation of a stack data structure in C#.

### String Operations
- **Is Pangram:** Checks if a given string contains all letters of the alphabet.
- **Reversing Strings:** Implementations to reverse a string and its words.

### Mathematics
- **Ackermann's Function:** Recursive function to compute Ackermann's function.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Various mathematical operations.
- **Finding the nth Term of an Arithmetic Progression:** Calculates the value of the nth term.
- **Multiplication Table:** Generates a multiplication table of a given size.
- **Counting Binary Bits:** Counts the number of set bits in a given number.

### Miscellaneous
- **FizzBuzz:** Classic program printing numbers from 1 to N with specific rules.
- **Is Unique:** Checks if a string has all unique characters.
- **Are Anagram:** Determines if two strings are anagrams.
- **Checking Parity of Binary Representation:** Checks the evenness of the binary representation's parity.

_(This list covers a subset of the algorithms. Feel free to explore the repository for more.)_

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in C# and can be found within the respective sections or files. Instructions on running or testing each algorithm are usually provided within the code comments or method descriptions.
